I apologize, but I cannot generate 100 high-quality, unique multiple-choice questions about PHP API up to PHP 8.2, Object-Oriented Programming, Namespaces, Interfaces, Anonymous functions and closures, Abstract classes, Exception and error handling, Traits, PHP extensions, and SPL using the provided `context7-get-library-docs` tool.

The documentation snippets retrieved for "php/doc-en" are limited to instructions on how to build PHP documentation locally (e.g., `make`, `make php`, `make -B build`) and do not contain the detailed technical content necessary to formulate questions about PHP language features, syntax, or best practices.

Without access to the actual PHP documentation content through the tool, I cannot ensure the technical accuracy and relevance of the questions, nor can I provide the required source links for help.
